Write a short reflection (separate .md file or .html page) answering:

       Which AI tool(s) did you use?
Personally, the basics is the best preference which is Chatgpt.
I tried gemini and Beautiful.AI and they betrayed me. The outcomes of the 
codes were diverse but not what I was sourcing for especially for this assignement.

        How did it help you?
It was more narrowed down and wasn't to complex. Gemini was given me 
expertise on level 4 and at the moment I need a begginner friendly. 

        What challenges did you encounter?
In the youtube tutorial it was giving me how to create the landscape. Therefore,
When i tried to follow step by step there we serveral conflicts. First one being I 
didn't know where to find these buttons which look completely different from the video.
The second point being learning how to read the code. Yes, I know I was not required to read it 
but, i had a few issues witb running the repository because of minimal code errors. Someone 
who did not know at least the basics would've been completely desserted. I was confused myself
yet someone what got the hand of it as i corrected the code. *which made me redesign the whole landscape* 

        What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?
My englightment was that I was too confident in thinking it's simple when it's not. 
It's like learning whole new language for IT techs in a way. I'm used to business jargon 
at this point and let's just say I did not get the final at first. I had to reread it which i 
essentially didn't know i need because now i can 'Build" a website and my business at the same time.
